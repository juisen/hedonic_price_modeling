## How Does a Recession Affect the Elasticity of Residential Property Prices with Changes in Different Housing Characteristics?

Using a sample of residential properties that were sold in Iowa between 20016 and 2010, a log-log model is created to show that every 10% increase in the lot area increase the sale price by 1.94% on average if there was no recession. However, given the same property during a recession, the return of lot area on the price decreases by 0.32 percentage points from 1.94% to 1.62%.
