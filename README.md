## How Does a Recession Affect the Elasticity of Residential Property Prices with Changes in Different Housing Characteristics?

Using a sample of 1460 residential properties that were sold in Iowa between 2006 and 2010, the impact of the Great Recession on the elasticity of housing prices is analysed with respect to changes in the lot area. Given the logarithm of inflation-adjusted sale prices as the dependent variable, the linear model specified in *data_analysis.ipynb* is comprised of 11 covariatesâ€”all of which are statistically significant at the 0.10 significance level. The model explains 80% of the variability in sale prices since hedonic features were included. There exists an interaction term between the logarithm of lot area (initially measured in square feet) and whether the property was sold during the recession. In that regard, every 10% increase in the lot area increases the sale price by 1.94% on average if there was no recession. However, given the same property during a recession, it becomes slightly less elastic: the return of lot area on the price decreases by 0.32 percentage points from 1.94% to 1.62%. From the perspective of a homeowner who is looking to sell a house, the Great Recession easily amounted to thousands of dollars in unrealized losses after controlling for hedonic features and adjusting for inflation.
